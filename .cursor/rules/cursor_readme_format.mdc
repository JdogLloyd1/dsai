# Cursor-Oriented README Guide

Use this rule when creating or editing READMEs (or project overview docs) that will be used as context by Cursor. The goal is to store **maximum useful information** so Cursor can generate and modify code correctly for this project.

## Purpose: Cursor as consumer

- **Primary consumer**: Cursor (and similar AI tools) will use the README as context when answering questions, generating code, or refactoring.
- **Goal**: Enable correct, project-consistent code by documenting structure, conventions, entry points, and where to look things up.
- **Principle**: Prefer **explicit over implicit**. Name files, paths, and patterns so the model can resolve references without guessing.
- **Complements**: A human-focused README can live in the same file; use clear section headers so both humans and Cursor can find what they need.

---

## What to include for Cursor

Include these so Cursor can navigate and generate code reliably:

- **Project summary**: One short paragraph—what the repo does and in what domain (e.g. "Data science course materials; Python and R scripts for APIs and agents").
- **Repository layout**: Which folders and key files exist and their **role** (e.g. `01_query_api/` = first module, `04_lab_query.py` = lab entry point).
- **Tech stack**: Languages, runtimes, key frameworks, and package managers (e.g. Python 3.11, R 4.x, `requirements.txt` vs `pyproject.toml`).
- **Entry points**: Main scripts or apps to run, and in what order when relevant (e.g. "Run `01_ollama.sh` before Python scripts that call Ollama").
- **Conventions**: Naming, coding style, where tests live, and pointer to project rules (e.g. `.cursor/rules/coding_style.mdc`).
- **Environment & secrets**: What env vars or config files are needed (e.g. `API_KEY`, `.env`), without putting secrets in the README.
- **APIs and libraries**: Which external APIs or core libraries are used, with links to their official docs.

---

## Project structure & file references

Use **explicit paths and roles** so Cursor can open or reference the right files.

- List directories and their purpose; call out files that are entry points or canonical examples.
- Use consistent path format: relative to repo root, e.g. `01_query_api/04_lab_query.py`, not `./04_lab_query.py` when describing the project.
- Reference other docs in the repo (e.g. `.cursor/rules/`, `docs/`) so Cursor knows where to find rules and specs.

Example:

```markdown
## Project structure

- `01_query_api/` — API query labs; start with [`03_mbta_api_test.py`](01_query_api/03_mbta_api_test.py) then [`04_lab_query.py`](01_query_api/04_lab_query.py).
- `06_agents/` — Ollama-based agents; run [`01_ollama.sh`](06_agents/01_ollama.sh) before Python/R scripts.
- `07_rag/` — RAG examples; data in `07_rag/data/`, entry scripts `02_txt.py` / `03_csv.py` / `04_sqlite.py`.
- `.cursor/rules/` — Project rules (coding style, README format, tools). Cursor applies these when editing matching files.
```

---

## Tech stack & environment

Document runtimes and tooling so Cursor chooses correct syntax and commands.

- **Languages & versions**: e.g. Python 3.11+, R 4.3+.
- **Package management**: e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`, or `renv` for R.
- **Env and config**: Required env vars; config file names and purpose (e.g. `.env` for API keys). Do not paste secrets.

Example:

```markdown
## Tech stack

- **Python**: 3.11+. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or per-folder if present).
- **R**: 4.3+. Use `renv` in folders that contain `renv.lock`.
- **Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `MBTA_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or equivalent). See [MBTA API key](https://api-v3.mbta.com/portal).
```

---

## Conventions & patterns

Describe patterns Cursor should follow when generating or editing code.

- **Naming**: e.g. "Scripts are numbered `01_`, `02_` for sequence; activities use `ACTIVITY_`, `LAB_` prefixes."
- **Style**: Point to project rules, e.g. "Follow [`.cursor/rules/coding_style.mdc`](.cursor/rules/coding_style.mdc) for R and Python."
- **File roles**: e.g. "Helper code lives in `functions.py` / `functions.R` per folder; scripts in that folder import from them."

Example:

```markdown
## Conventions

- Numbered scripts (`01_*.py`, `02_*.py`) indicate run order within a folder.
- Shared helpers: [`functions.py`](06_agents/functions.py) and [`functions.R`](06_agents/functions.R) in each module.
- Coding style: see [`.cursor/rules/coding_style.mdc`](.cursor/rules/coding_style.mdc). Use it when generating or editing `.R` and `.py` files.
```

---

## APIs and libraries

List external services and core libraries with **official doc links**. Cursor can use these to look up correct APIs and function signatures.

- **APIs**: Name the service and link to its API reference or getting-started page.
- **Libraries**: Name the library and link to docs (e.g. Requests, httr, ollama Python client).

Example:

```markdown
## APIs and libraries

- **MBTA API**: [MBTA V3 API](https://api-v3.mbta.com/docs/swagger/index.html); used in `01_query_api/`.
- **Ollama**: [Ollama API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md); Python usage in [`02_using_ollama.py`](06_agents/02_using_ollama.py).
- **Python HTTP**: [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). **R HTTP**: [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/).
```

---

## Code examples & file references

Where helpful, include **short code snippets** that show project-specific usage, and **reference the real file** so Cursor can read full context.

- Prefer one canonical example per concept (e.g. "how we call the MBTA API in this project").
- Put the snippet in a fenced code block with language; below or above it, link to the file: e.g. "See [`01_query_api/04_lab_query.py`](01_query_api/04_lab_query.py) for the full script."
- For env or config, show the pattern without real keys.

Example:

```markdown
## Example: calling the API (Python)

This project uses a single module for the MBTA client and reads the key from the environment:

\`\`\`python
import os
import requests

API_KEY = os.environ.get("MBTA_API_KEY")
url = "https://api-v3.mbta.com/vehicles?filter[route]=1"
r = requests.get(url, headers={"x-api-key": API_KEY})
\`\`\`

Full script: [`01_query_api/04_lab_query.py`](01_query_api/04_lab_query.py). API reference: [MBTA V3 API](https://api-v3.mbta.com/docs/swagger/index.html).
```

---

## External documentation links

Provide stable links so Cursor (and developers) can resolve API and library details.

- **API docs**: Official REST/GraphQL docs, Swagger/OpenAPI URLs when available.
- **Libraries**: Official "Getting started" or "Reference" for each major library used in the repo.
- **Tools**: Cursor rules, Markdown, or tooling docs if they affect how the project is documented or built.

Suggested link section:

```markdown
## Reference links

| Resource | URL |
|----------|-----|
| MBTA V3 API | https://api-v3.mbta.com/docs/swagger/index.html |
| Ollama API | https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md |
| Python Requests | https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ |
| R httr | https://httr.r-lib.org/ |
| CommonMark (Markdown) | https://commonmark.org/help/ |
```

---

## Formatting for parseability

Use consistent structure so Cursor can locate sections reliably.

- **Headers**: One `#` for the document title; `##` for major sections; `###` for subsections. Use the same section names across READMEs when possible (e.g. "Project structure", "Tech stack", "APIs and libraries").
- **Lists**: Use bullets for options or roles; numbered lists for steps or sequence.
- **Paths**: Use repo-relative paths in links, e.g. `[04_lab_query.py](01_query_api/04_lab_query.py)`.
- **Code**: Fenced blocks with language tag; keep snippets short and point to the real file for full context.

- [ ] Short project summary at the top.
- [ ] Project structure section with paths and roles of key dirs/files.
- [ ] Tech stack (languages, package managers, env/config needs).
- [ ] Entry points and run order when relevant.
- [ ] Conventions and pointer to `.cursor/rules/` or style docs.
- [ ] APIs and libraries with official doc links.
- [ ] At least one code example with a file reference; more for complex flows.
- [ ] Reference links section (table or list) for APIs and main libraries.
- [ ] Consistent `##` / `###` headers and repo-relative paths in links.
- [ ] No secrets; only env var names and config file names.
