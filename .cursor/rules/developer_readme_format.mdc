# Developer README Formatting Guide

Use this rule when writing or editing README files. Focus on clarity for developers: quick scanning, consistent structure, and easy navigation.

---

## Table of Contents

- [Purpose & principles](#purpose--principles)
- [Structure & headers](#structure--headers)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents-in-the-readme)
- [Code examples](#code-examples)
- [Diagrams](#diagrams)
- [Lists & bullets](#lists--bullets)
- [External references](#external-references)
- [Quick checklist](#quick-checklist)

---

## Purpose & principles

- **Audience**: Developers (maintainers, contributors, API consumers). Assume technical literacy; avoid unnecessary hand-holding.
- **Goal**: Answer “what is this?”, “how do I run it?”, and “where do I go next?” in under two minutes.
- **Tone**: Direct, scannable, and factual. Prefer bullets and short paragraphs over long prose.
- **Length**: Prefer brevity. Link to detailed docs instead of duplicating them in the README.

---

## Structure & headers

Use a consistent hierarchy so humans and tools can parse the doc:

- **Single `#`**: Document title only (e.g. `# Project Name`).
- **`##`**: Major sections (Overview, Installation, Usage, API, Contributing).
- **`###`**: Subsections within those. Avoid going deeper than `###` for normal READMEs.

Example outline:

```markdown
# My Service

## Overview
## Requirements
## Installation
## Usage
## Configuration
## API Reference
## Contributing
## License
```

Keep section names predictable. Common patterns: [Overview](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/), [Getting started](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes), Installation, Usage, API/Reference, Contributing, License.

---

## Table of contents (in the README)

- Place the **Table of Contents (TOC)** near the top, after a short intro (1–3 sentences).
- Use **anchor links** so readers can jump to sections. In GitHub/GitLab, anchors are usually auto-generated from headings (lowercase, spaces → hyphens).

Example:

```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [API Reference](#api-reference)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
```

This gives developers a map of the README and speeds up navigation. See [GitHub’s generated IDs](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/main/lib/html/pipeline/toc_filter.rb) for how heading anchors work.

---

## Code examples

- Use **fenced code blocks** with a language tag so syntax highlighting works.
- Prefer **short, runnable** snippets. For long or multi-file examples, link to a `docs/` or `examples/` path.
- Add a **one-line comment** when the next step is non-obvious.

Example:

```markdown
## Installation

Install with pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -e .
\`\`\`

Set your API key (required for the client):

\`\`\`bash
export MY_API_KEY=your_key_here
\`\`\`
```

For API or SDK usage, one concise example is enough; link to full API docs for the rest.

---

## Diagrams

Use **Mermaid** for flow or structure when it helps more than text. Prefer 1–2 diagrams per README (e.g. high-level architecture, or “where to start”).

**Flow: how a new developer might use the README**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Open README] --> B[Read Overview]
  B --> C[Check Requirements]
  C --> D[Install]
  D --> E[Run Example]
  E --> F[Link to API Docs]
```

**Typical README section flow**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph README
    O[Overview]
    I[Installation]
    U[Usage]
    R[Reference]
  end
  O --> I --> U --> R
```

Keep diagrams simple. For syntax and options, see [Mermaid docs](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).

---

## Lists & bullets

- Use **bullets** for non-sequential items (features, options, prerequisites).
- Use **numbered lists** for steps that must be done in order (e.g. installation, first run).
- Use **checklists** (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) for “before you start” or “verify setup” lists.

Example:

```markdown
## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Access to the Foo API ([sign up](https://example.com/signup))

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set `FOO_API_KEY` and run `python main.py`.
```

---

## External references

Link to official or canonical docs so developers can go deeper without leaving the README:

- **APIs**: Link to the official API reference or OpenAPI/Swagger URL.
- **Libraries**: Link to the library’s README or “Getting started” (e.g. [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/)).
- **Markdown**: [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) and [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) for syntax.
- **Mermaid**: [Mermaid live editor](https://mermaid.live/) and [documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).

Example in README:

```markdown
## API usage

This client wraps the [Foo API](https://docs.foo.com/api). For full endpoint details, see the [official API reference](https://docs.foo.com/api/reference).
```

---

## Quick checklist

When writing or reviewing a developer-focused README:

- [ ] Single `#` title; `##` and `###` for sections.
- [ ] TOC with anchor links near the top.
- [ ] Short overview (what it is, why it exists).
- [ ] Clear installation/run steps with copy-paste code blocks.
- [ ] At least one usage example; link to more.
- [ ] 1–2 Mermaid diagrams only if they add clarity.
- [ ] Bullets for options/features; numbers for ordered steps.
- [ ] Links to external API/library docs where relevant.
- [ ] Contributing and/or license section if the repo is open source.
